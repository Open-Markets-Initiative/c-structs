## Omi C Packed Structs

Packed C Structs for binary protocols.

This project contains source generated data aligned 'packed' structs for packet overlay.  Any dynamically sized structs are excluded, if you need full parsers please see our other projects.


## Development

Updates are greatly appreciated; however, this entire repository is source generated...including the words you are reading right now. Code generation requires a different workflow.  The recommended process is to create an issue with suggested edits and explanation.  If the changes are applicable to some or all protocols, we will update the model and regenerate.

| Protocol Count | Generated Lines |
| --- | --- |
| 231 | 262,529 |

Please report any errors as issues.  Include a small note on the protocol and version, and a minimal capture demonstrating the problem.

Any similarities between existing people, places and/or protocols is purely incidental.

Enjoy.
